Migration Summary
=================

Files moved to new bounded-context packages:
- core/domain primitives -> kernel (Email.kt, PhoneNumber.kt)
- Tutor and Pet entities -> customer.core.domain.entity
- Event and Recurrence classes -> scheduling.core.domain
- Identity auth classes and configs moved under identity.*
- Customer related commands, ports, results and services moved under customer.*
- Scheduling related commands, ports, results, services and scheduler moved under scheduling.*
- NotificationPort and NotificationAdapter moved under notification.*
- JPA adapters and repositories moved to their respective subdomains (customer or scheduling)

Updated import statements to reference new packages.

Manual TODOs
------------
- Review build scripts if any package based component scanning is configured.
- Verify tests compile; some may require package line adjustments.
- Remove now-empty old package directories if desired.
